                Who is Karl Popper?

            <p>
                Karl Popper was born in Vienna, Austria on July 28, 1902. He spent most of his 
                adult life in Britain as a professor in philosophy. He is known mainly for being 
                a philosopher of science; However, he has also had a large impact on political 
                philosophy. One of his biggest contributions to science is the concept of
                falsifiability, that is, “a theory is genuinely scientific only if it is possible
                in principle to establish that it is false.” (Criterion of falsifiability). He also
                is known for the ideas of the ‘open society’, ‘evolutionary epistemology’, and
                ‘objective knowledge’. Each one of these is driven by the same underlying concept.
                is, “that our knowledge always is imperfect, though it can be improved overtime by
                rational criticism”. (Bawden & Robinson, 2012) One of my favorite quotes of his is:
                <br>
                <br>
                “It is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood.” – Karl Popper
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding this idea, allows one to have a new respect for disagreements. 
                Specifically, because acknowledging words are imperfect acknowledges that every
                rson’s vocal opinion is flawed. Overtime, ideas get lost in the translation of 
                communication which may lead to heavily differing views. However, if one had the 
                power to truly explain what they are thinking, express the root of their thought, 
                everyone would understand one another. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, understanding Karl Popper, one of the 20th century’s most influential 
                philosophers, allows one to grasp a deeper view on the concept of being.

                Three times a year mercury goes into retrograde. What does that mean? Well, 
                in simple terms, it appears to be moving backwards, slower, in the sky.  In 
                reality, Mercury isn’t actually changing direction or slowing down but that
                 doesn’t stop people from speculating about the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mercury represents the planet of communication. You could say it’s the 
                intellect of the planets. There is a common understanding that this event may 
                curve our ability to communicate, and one may need to listen and think deeply 
                before speaking. Just like the planet slows down, we should too. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, there is a common pattern of technology breaking down during this 
                time. Have you had any issues with technology in the last few weeks? It’s 
                easy to blame any minor inconvenience on the retrograde during this time- 
                which is why it gets a bad rep. But I think there is something important to be 
                learned about a time when communication is slowed, it highlights the need for us
                read between the lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking time and listening to your inner monologue from an outside perspective
                 is good for your soul any day. However, on the chance that mercury in 
                 retrograde is really affecting us, you might as well prioritize that goal
                  even more so right now.
