                <strong>Hello!</strong><br>
                My name is Katherine Rochon. I am currently a fourth-year student at MSU, 
                studying Computer Science with a cognate in Media and Information. I enjoy the
                logic behind coding and being able to systematically solve problems. I hope to 
                go into either software or web development after college. I also plan to move out of Michigan
                and immerse myself in a big city. Before moving to college, I lived in the same 
                small town in the same house my entire life. As nice as that was, I am ready for 
                a change and seek to go outside of my comfort zone.  Although, I never moved growing
                was lucky enough to have parents who love to travel. This introduced me to my love
                for architecture and gave me a glimpse of what could be in my future.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from school, I enjoy:
